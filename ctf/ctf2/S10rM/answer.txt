1. vuln function prints buffer so Format String Vulnerability can be used
2. check the offset by sending multiple %x (8 in my case after 3 characters)
3. Now make payload "BBB"+<address of exit>+"%8$<decimal of address of hello>x"+"%8$n" and pass it to executable which will replace got entry of exit with hello and print the flag
4. Previous payload will print millions of spaces so will take some time this can be easily resuced by writing it in 2 parts which is present in exploit.py
